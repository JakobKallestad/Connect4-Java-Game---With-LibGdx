MLGFilter:

This was basically something I just added to the complete already working normal version of the game. I made this for two reasons:

1. It was fun.
2. To learn about animation in libGdx.

I definitely learned a lot about animations, and it was a bit harder than i originally thought.
I also tried to make the mlg-part like an add-on, so that the modularity in the program was kept and not a huge amount of code had to be rewritten.
It was difficult to not rewrite at least a bit of code in the original GameScreen, but I tried to keep it low on lines.
